# CSSReorder

**Very early version, use on your own risk. Stay tuned for updates.**

Formerly known as CSSComb but was renamed to avoid people confusion.
This plugin is NOT supported by [CSSComb organization](https://github.com/csscomb) and have no shared codebase.
CSSComb author is not responsible for any bugs.
It is only my initiative to implement original CSSComb features as native to IDEA platform.

Sorting CSS properties in predefined order.

Install from IntelliJ IDEA plugin repositories or download manually from http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pr=&pluginId=7164

Feel free to report bugs, request features and contribute.
