# CSSReorder
## About
**Very early version, use on your own risk. Stay tuned for updates.**

Sorting CSS properties in predefined order.
Consider also using node.js/npm version: <a href="https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js">csscomb.js</a>

## Disclaimer
Requires IntelliJ platform version &ge; 13.

Formerly known as CSSComb but was renamed to avoid people confusion.
This plugin is NOT supported by [CSSComb organization](https://github.com/csscomb) and have no shared codebase.
CSSComb author is not responsible for any bugs.
This is only my initiative to implement original CSSComb features as native to IDEA platform.

Based on [platform provided rearrangement](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2012/10/arrange-your-code-automatically-with-intellij-idea-12/).

## Installation
Install from IntelliJ IDEA plugin repositories or download manually [here](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pr=&pluginId=7164).

## Usage
Should be invoked using *Code&nbsp;â†’&nbsp;Rearrange* action on CSS files.
This action also can be invoked on code reformatting action by checking corresponding option (Rearrange entries) in
[Reformat code dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/reformat-file-dialog.html).
